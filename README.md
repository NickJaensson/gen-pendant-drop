This Matlab library is used to generate pendant drop shapes by solving the 
Young-Laplace equation, using a spectral method. Both simple interfaces 
(only surface tension) and elastic interfaces can be simulated.

The code is based on the TensioMet code of M. Nagel 
(http://tensiomet.sourceforge.net) and it was adapted by N. Jaensson
